            <strong>Classic Lolita</strong>&nbsp;is often considered a more mature style that tends to be more historically inspired than other styles. It tends to focus more on elegance and less on cuteness. It also tends to look more toned-down than other styles, as some Classic dresses could even pass for fancy "event" dresses. This style can sometimes border either on Sweet or Gothic Lolita.<br>
            <br>  Typical Classic Lolita dresses are usually of more muted colours such as dusty pastels and jewel tones. Classic Lolitas tend to use cream/off-white as their outfit's neutral color rather than stark white.&nbsp;Floral prints and solid colors are a common choice, although fancier or cuter prints are also seen.<br><br>  "A-Line" instead of bell-shaped skirts are also much more common in Classic Lolita than in other styles.&nbsp;Headwear includes round or thin rectangle headdresses, headbows (smaller bows are often preferred to head-eating bows), hair corsages/flowers, or elegant hats.<br><br>  Examples of Classical Lolita brands include&nbsp;

            <strong>Gothic Lolita</strong>&nbsp; is a gothic inspired Lolita sub-style. It is characterized by a darker clothing and make-up. It is widely considered to be the most popular style of lolita. The style was popularized by Japanese musician Mana.<br>
            <br> Elegant Gothic Lolita or EGL is a term coined by 
            <a href="https://lolitafashion.fandom.com/wiki/Moi_Meme_Moitie">Moitie</a>
            to describe their style of Gothic Lolita, but it has been adopted by many to describe the whole Gothic Lolita style in general. Like the term Elegant Gothic Aristocrat, or EGA, many people may argue that EGL is only to be used when referring to all-Moitie outfits, but many disagree and disregard this. In the past EGL was used as a blanket term for all styles of Lolita and even to describe the people who were Lolitas, and this is sometimes still used and still seen in the name of the community EGL.

            <strong>Sweet Lolita</strong>&nbsp; is the most 'child-like' and one of the most popular of the lolita styles. There is a heavy emphasis on looking cute and girly. Sweet Lolita dresses often feature pastel colors, lots of ruffles, bows, and cute themed prints.
            <br><br>Many people mistake OTT (or over-the-top) Sweet Lolita as the only kind of Sweet Lolita that there is, but many Sweet Lolita outfits can be just as simple or complex as any other style of Lolita.<br>
            <br><br><strong>Bittersweet Lolita</strong>is not necessarily a Lolita style, but a term coined in the West to refer to printed 
            <a href="https://lolitafashion.fandom.com/wiki/Moi_Meme_Moitie">Sweet Lolita</a> 
            articles of clothing in the black colorway. However, many people choose not to use the term, as it is considered by many to be an arbitrary title. There is nothing that differentiates Bittersweet Lolita from any other Sweet Lolita outfit besides the extensive use of the color black.
