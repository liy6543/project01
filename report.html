            The website I designed is aimed to help people who do not understand Lolita culture know more about Lolita and to provide a platform for girls who like Lolita culture to communicate and provide more convenient ways to buy Lolita clothes. I made five pages. Each page is interesting and meaningful. And they all have favicon. My website has a lot of hyperlinks. You can go to other pages by clicking on pictures or text. And my web pages fit the size of a phone and a computer, and each page has navigation links. HTML, CSS, and js are all included in my folder. I didn’t use any libraries or frameworks and also added a lot of my own ideas. All files names are lowercase and contain only Numbers and letters. In addition, my website has passed W3C's HTML validator and CSS validator without any warnings or errors.

            I like this website. I love this website. It's cute. I've always wanted to learn about some of the culture around Lolita, and this site has helped me a lot. I like the home page very much.A video and a few words gave me some understanding of Lolita culture. In the following presentation, I learned that Lolita is divided into styles. Classical, gothic, and sweet. I love the classic Lolita. It's beautiful. The film is the story of two teenage girls with totally different personalities who break their differences and form a true friendship. The meeting of girls who like Lolita costumes and handsome girls represents the collision of Lolita culture and trend culture, which is very meaningful. Show the page, the three girls are very beautiful. Animation brings the page to life, and I appreciate it. If you want to buy Lolita costumes, the link to the final page’s pictures are convenient. All in all, you really did a good job. However, I still want to put forward a small opinion, the whole website part of the font, the color is light, is not very clear, if change, your website will be better.
